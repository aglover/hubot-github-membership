# Hubot Github Membership

This script adds a user to a Github team. You must provide the script with a Github token and a 
team id. 

## Configuration
 
 *  HUBOT_GITHUB_TOKEN
 *	HUBOT_DEFAULT_TEAM_ID

## Command

 * `add <username> to Github`

## TODO

 * It would be nice to make this script add people to various teams as needed. Right now, you can only add someone to one pre-configured team.
